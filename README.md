* intersect with triangle mesh
* translate / rotate / scale

### Textures
* diffuse
* specular

### Camera
* perspective

### Lighting
* hard shadows

### Scene
* load from file

## As a follow-up it can be better improved with
### Geometry
* bounding box
* k-d trees

### Textures
* normal
* bitmap
* reflection
* refraction
* layered

### Camera
* parallel
* fish eye

### Lighting
* soft shadows
* global illumination

### Scene
* save scenes
* save renderings
* environment map

## Building
A simple **go build** should do the job
